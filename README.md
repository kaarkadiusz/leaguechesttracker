## LeagueChestTracker

This is a tool for tracking player's acquired mastery chests in League of Legends. Ranked queues in league don't show that kind of information while in champion select, so this tool aims at solving this problem.

It uses **next.js** framework, **tailwindcss** for styling and data acquired from official [Riot Developer Portal API](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol#data-dragon_champions)
Run development server using `npm run dev` or visit [this site](https://leaguechesttracker.vercel.app/) hosted on Vercel.
